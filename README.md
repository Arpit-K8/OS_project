Page Replacement Simulator


This repository contains the implementation of an Operating System simulation project. The aim is to simulate page replacement algorithms, including LRU (Least Recently Used), FIFO (First In First Out), and Optimal Algorithm, with additional options such as a Hybrid Algorithm and AI-based suggestions for determining the best algorithm for a given string of page references.

### Structure of the Project  
Homepage (index.html)  
The main entry point of the project is index.html, which serves as the homepage. From here, you can navigate to various sections of the simulation:  

- Calculate Metrics 
  The metric.html file contains the code for calculating and displaying various metrics related to the page replacement algorithms.  

- Theory
  The theory.html section explains the theoretical background and concepts behind the implemented algorithms.  

- About Us 
  The aboutus.html page provides information about the contributors to this project and its overall purpose.  

### Features  
- Implementation of LRU, FIFO, and Optimal algorithms.  
- Exploration of a Hybrid Algorithm for enhanced functionality.  
- AI-powered suggestions for selecting the most suitable algorithm based on the string of page references.  
- User-friendly interface for running simulations and viewing results.  
- Detailed metrics calculation for each algorithm.
